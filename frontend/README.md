# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

API Connection:
---------------
All API calls are made to the Django backend running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`. Make sure the backend is running when using the frontend.

# ParkZone Frontend

This is the frontend for the **ParkZone Parking Management System** built with **ReactJS**.

##  Project Structure

- `src/Pages/` - Contains all main pages (CustomerHome, ViewParking, MyAccount, etc.)
- `src/Component/` - Shared components (if any)
- `src/axiosInstance.js` - Axios instance configured for backend API calls
- `App.js` - Main application routes and layout

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run the App

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

##  Protected Routes

Pages like `/customer-home`, `/my-account`, `/profile` are protected and require a valid customer session (checked from `localStorage`).

##  API Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/customers/login` - Custom login for customers
- `POST /api/token/` - JWT login for admin (Django user)
- `GET /api/parkinglots/` - View available slots
- `POST /api/reservations/` - Make reservation
- `GET /api/reservations/` - View current bookings
- `PUT /api/customers/<id>/` - Update profile
- `GET /api/customers/<id>/` - Get customer details

##  Notes

- Login details are stored in `localStorage`
- API requests use a centralized `axiosInstance`
- Page access is restricted based on authentication presence
